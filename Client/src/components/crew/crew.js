            US Coast Guard Licensed 100 Ton Master Captain
          </GlobalStyle.TextNormal>
          <GlobalStyle.TextNormalIndent>
            Capt. Joe has been working on fishing boats since he was 15 years
            old and has been fishing the NJ waters since he was 5. He spent 10
            years working as deckhand aboard the Dauntless out of Pt. Pleasant,
            NJ and has been a USCG Licensed 100 Ton Master Captain for 7 years.
            During his time as a young captain he trained under the direct
            tutelage of Captain Butch Egerter who has fished the Jersey Coast
            for over 50 years. Over the years, Joe has spent time running head
            boats and local charter boats. Capt. Joe is a man on a mission and
            that mission is to get you on productive fishing grounds and to see
            the joy in a customer's face when they've landed a personal best
            fish or landed something they have never seen before. Filling a
            cooler to bring home for dinner is always on the to-do list and by
            days end you will have your fair share, but what really brings pride
            to Joe is the seeing someone grow as a fisherman and giving the
            customer an experience that elicits the same obsession that took
            over Joe at a young age.

              boats and charter boats, Capt Mike has the ability to get you on
              the meat. Over the years, Mike has become well versed in inshore

              Bluefish. Mike prides himself on being a people person and looks

              on trips anytime he can . At just 8 years old, you will be
              impressed by what this young boy can do. If your charter has the
              space and Mike is on board, you might get the opportunity to meet
              our up and coming fishing expert.

          As is common on most charter boats, you have a couple steady deckhands
          to work the deck and a captain or two that reliably puts people on the
          fish day-in and day-out. On the Nearfall, most trips are done in a
          similar fashion, however we also have a team who will be with us
          several times throughout the year participating in local tournaments
          when the opportunities present themselves. If you are lucky, you may
          have the opportunity to meet one of our team members as a fill-in
          deckhand when needed. Each team member is unique in their own way,
          passionate for the sport, and eager to share some of their wisdom with
          the customers. All Nearfall team members have several years of
          experience on the local charter and head boats and are true
          professionals.
